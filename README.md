## DATA
I used data consisting of 1 csv file & 3 json file
    *Game ID
    *Creation Time (in Epoch format)
    *Game Duration (in seconds)
    *Season ID
    *Winner (1 = team1, 2 = team2)
    *First Baron, dragon, tower, blood, inhibitor and Rift Herald (1 = team1, 2 = team2, 0 = none)
    *Champions and summoner spells for each team (Stored as Riot's champion and summoner spell IDs)
    *The number of tower, inhibitor, Baron, dragon and Rift Herald kills each team has
    *The 5 bans of each team (Again, champion IDs are used)

### OBJECTIVE
Show relationships between column variables
  * Is the amount of towers/inhibitors taken affecting win condition?
  * Is the amount of monsters/objectives taken affecting win condition?
  * Is it due to champion bans?
  * Is champions correlated with game duration?
  * If a certain objective is taken first, does that help win condition?
  * Does a group of champions have better advantages over the other champions who are less likely to be banned?
